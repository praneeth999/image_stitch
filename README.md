# Image-Stiching
## Overview
Image stitching refers to the process of combining multiple overlapping images taken from different viewpoints to produce a single, cohesive, high-resolution image, often resulting in a panorama. This process involves several steps including keypoint detection, feature matching, transformation estimation (like homography), image warping, and blending to ensure a seamless transition between the combined images.
